# Project Title: MSMQ_Subscriber_Process

# Project Description: 
Inter App Communication using [Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/msmq/ms711472(v=vs.85)) between two Windows Presentation Foundation [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=azurestackps-2.5.0) Applications to demostrate messaging with MSMQ using Model View View-Model pattern, such that when Application 1 (process A) publishes data Application 2 (process B) subscribes automatically to recieve the data from the queue.

This Application reads the machine name, runs a PowerShell Script to activate MSMQ without manually activating MSMQ, checks if the machine has private or public queues then creates a queue. Â If none is found it prompts the user with an alert that it could not create queue. Exceptions were handled while the app creates and sends data to the queue.
